## repeated measure ANOVA assumptions 

# Spherecity / Homongeneity of variance 
# Assumption of sphericity
# The assumption of sphericity can be tested using Mauchlyâ€™s test of sphericity. 
# The violation of the assumption of sphericity can lead to an increase in type II error 
# (loss of statistical power) and the F value is not valid.
import pingouin as pg
pg.sphericity(data=df_melt, dv='leaves', subject='Id', within='time_points')[-1]

# Interpretation -> 
# If the p value is greater than .05 (e.g., 0.8883) this means non-significant (p > 0.05), the data met the assumption of sphericity, 
# and variances of differences of independent variables are equal and met 

# Normality 
# install pingouin as !pip install pingouin
pg.normality(data=df_melt, dv='leaves', group='time_points')

# Shapiro-Wilk test can be used for checking the assumption for normality of each 
# level of the within-subjects factor
